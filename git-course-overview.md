# 🏢 Git for Real Companies — TaskFlow Team Training

> **Welcome to TechCorp's Git Bootcamp!**
> You'll learn Git the way REAL dev teams use it — by playing the role of a junior developer at a fictional (but realistic) company, working on a real project with a real team.

## 🎮 How This Course Works

This isn't a boring tutorial. This is a **simulation**.

- 🧑‍💻 **You are Mehdi** — a junior developer who just got hired
- 📖 **The story** — things go wrong, teammates make mistakes, deadlines hit, production breaks
- ⭐ **XP System** — earn XP for every exercise you complete
- 🏅 **Achievements** — unlock badges for special milestones
- 💥 **Boss Fights** — high-pressure scenarios that test everything you've learned
- ❓ **Pop Quizzes** — test your understanding before moving on
- 🏆 **Final Score** — aim for the maximum 3000 XP across all 6 days

> 💡 **Golden Rule:** You learn Git by TYPING COMMANDS, not by reading. If you just read, you'll forget it in a week. TYPE. EVERY. COMMAND.
